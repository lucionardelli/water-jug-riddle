# Water Jug Riddle

## Overview

Build an application that solves the Water Jug Riddle for dynamic inputs (X, Y, Z). The
simulation should have a UI to display state changes for each state for each jug (Empty, Full, or
Partially Full).

You have an X-gallon and a Y-gallon jug that you can fill from a lake. (Assume lake has unlimited
amount of water.) By using only an X-gallon and Y-gallon jug (no third jug), measure Z gallons of
water.

The jugs do not have markings to measure smaller quantities.

## Goals

1. Measure Z gallons of water in the most efficient way.
2. Build a UI where a user can enter any input for X, Y, Z and see the solution.
3. If no solution, display “No Solution”.

## Limitations

* No partial measurement. Each jug can be empty or full.
* Actions allowed: Fill, Empty, Transfer.
* Use one of the following programming languages: Scala, Java, Nodejs, Go, Python, C, C++, Kotlin.
